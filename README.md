# trmnl-waveshare-bridge
**Version:** 0.0.1  
**Status:** Early Development

An unofficial TRMNL compatibility project for Waveshare e-paper displays.  
Built on a [custom Waveshare EPD image library](https://github.com/Lambda-ex/waveshare-epd-image), this project fetches the current TRMNL screen and renders it on Raspberry Pi–connected Waveshare panels. Its goal is to make all Waveshare EPD devices usable with TRMNL, even when display dimensions or rendering characteristics differ.

## Credits

- **Waveshare** - for the e-paper display hardware and reference drivers that make these devices possible.
- **TRMNL** - for the platform and API that inspired this project and provides the display content it renders.

This project is unofficial and is not affiliated with or endorsed by Waveshare or TRMNL.
